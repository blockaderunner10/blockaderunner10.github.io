            Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object in Sol where life developed and found habitability. This is enabled by Earth once being a water world, the only one in the Solar System which had naturally sustaining liquid surface water. Almost all of Earth’s surface is covered by a large city constructed during the tail end of the 24th century. The remaining natural sections of the Earth’s surface are the peaks of mountains and the Antarctic Island chain (the southern pole). Earth's land is part of Earth's crust, consisting of several slowly moving tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges. Inside Earth's crust is a liquid outer core that generates the magnetosphere, deflecting most of the destructive solar winds and cosmic radiation.

            Earth has a dynamic atmosphere, which sustains Earth's surface conditions and protects it from most meteoroids and UV-light at entry. It has a composition of primarily nitrogen and oxygen. Water vapor is widely present in the atmosphere, forming clouds that cover most of the planet. The water vapor acts as a greenhouse gas and, together with other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), creates the conditions for both liquid surface water and water vapor to persist via the capturing of energy from the Sun's light. This process maintains the current average surface temperature of 15.96 °C, at which water is liquid under atmospheric pressure. Differences in the amount of captured energy between geographic regions (as with the equatorial region receiving more sunlight than the polar regions) drive atmospheric and ocean currents, producing a global climate system with different climate regions, and a range of weather phenomena such as precipitation, allowing components such as nitrogen to cycle.

            Earth is rounded into an ellipsoid with a circumference of about 40,000 km. It is the densest planet in the Solar System. Of the four rocky planets, it is the largest and most massive. Earth is about eight light-minutes away from the Sun and orbits it, taking a year (about 365.25 days) to complete one revolution. Earth rotates around its own axis in slightly less than a day (in about 23 hours and 56 minutes). Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to the perpendicular to its orbital plane around the Sun, producing seasons. Earth is orbited by one permanent natural satellite, the Moon, which orbits Earth at 384,400 km (1.28 light seconds) and is roughly a quarter as wide as Earth. Through tidal locking, the Moon always faces Earth with the same side, which causes tides, stabilizes Earth's axis, and gradually slows its rotation.
            <br><br>
            Earth, like most other bodies in the Solar System, is inhabited by a variety of sentient species primarily Humans (60%), Androids (10%) and other Alien species (20%). The population of earth is roughly 4 Trillion with the population ballooning following earths transition to a Ecumenopolis and the. Other life does currently exist on Earth (mainly Rodents, Birds and domesticated animals e.g. dogs) but a majority of species native to earth have been moved off-world to Mars or the newly constructed Niven ring-world.

            The Earth-Luna constituency elects 1958 seats to the Federal Parliament and 20 seats to the Federal Senate. It consistently votes for Union of Federal Socialists and Democrats or the Democratic-Liberal Party and has done so since the UFSD’s landslide victory in the year 2502.
