            The Coalition of Interstellar Nations is an interstellar organisation formed between 30,000-32,000 galactic years ago (26596-28369 Federal Years) (exact date lost due to early wars). It officially is a loose grouping designed to prevent wars, however over its several millennia its powers have expanded over some of its members to the point where the lines are blurred between CoIN and certain member states.
            <br><br>
            The Coalitions system of governance is characterised by 2 levels. The council of 9 (e.g. the Kingdom of  Yondarim or Xanid Suzerainty) and the Lower Nations (e.g. Aureate Alliance). The system in place frequently leads to the lower nations being subjicated by the Council of 9.
            <br><br>
            The history of the coalition is one of the longest in the galaxy with its current state dominating approximately 80% of inhabited systems.
