        Humans, or modern humans (Homo sapiens), are the most common and widespread non-hive intelligent life in the galaxy. The species is characterized by their hairlessness, bipedalism, and high intelligence, humans have a large brain and resulting cognitive skills that enable them to thrive in varied environments and develop complex societies and civilizations. Humans are highly social and tend to live in complex social structures composed of many cooperating and competing groups, from families and kinship networks to political states. As such, social interactions between humans have established a wide variety of values, social norms, languages, and rituals, each of which bolsters human society. The desire to understand and influence phenomena has motivated humanities development of science, technology, exploration, philosophy, religion and other conceptual frameworks.

        Although the term Human is normally attributed to the modern version of humans, scientifically it equates to all members of the genus ‘Homo’ with modern humans being the only living member of the genus. Anatomically modern humans emerged approximately 300,000 years ago on the planet Earth in the former continent of Africa, evolving from Homo heidelbergensis or a similar species and migrating out of Africa, gradually replacing or interbreeding with local populations of archaic humans. For most of their history humans were nomadic hunter-gatherers. Humans began exhibiting behavioural modernity about 160,000–60,000 years ago. The Neolithic Revolution, which began in Southwest Asia around 13,000 years ago (and separately in a few other places), saw the emergence of agriculture and permanent human settlement.  As populations became larger and denser, forms of governance developed within and between communities, and a large number of civilizations have risen and fallen. All this eventually culminated in World War III which led to the gradual unification of Earth into a Federal Republic, the United Federation of Nations.
        <br><br>
        Modern humans foray into space travel began in 1961 with the orbit of Russian national Yuri Gagarin, humanities exploration of space rapidly progressed leading to the Apollo 11 mission landing American astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin on Luna.  The following 50 years saw a step back in manned spaceflight, but this ended in the early 2020s with the establishment of Lunar bases and stations. On the 16th of august 2032 American Astronaut Nichole Ayers leading an international crew of Americans, Europeans, British, Canadian, and Japanese astronauts landed on the planet Mars becoming the first humans to set foot on another world. The following decades would see an increase in space based infrastructure and off-world bases. In the aftermath of World War III human spaceflight took a brief step back but this ended when the UFN began an extensive colonisation campaign within the confines of Sol. In the year 2134 decades of research paid off as the UFRS Enterprise became the first human craft to travel at speeds faster than light. Following this the human species exploded in population reaching an estimated 20 trillion in the year 2634 spread across millions of stars and hundreds of interstellar nations.

        Genes and the environment influence human biological variation in visible characteristics, physiology, disease susceptibility, mental abilities, body size, and life span. Though humans vary in many traits (such as genetic predispositions and physical features), any two humans are at least 99% genetically similar. Humans are sexually dimorphic: generally, males have greater body strength and females have a higher body fat percentage. At puberty, humans develop secondary sex characteristics. Females are capable of pregnancy, usually between puberty, at around 12 years old, and menopause, around the age of 50.
        <br><br>
        Humans are omnivorous, capable of consuming a wide variety of plant and animal material, and have used fire and other forms of heat to prepare and cook food since the time of Homo erectus. Humans can survive for up to eight weeks without food and several days without water. Humans are generally diurnal, sleeping on average seven to nine hours per day. Childbirth is dangerous, with a high risk of complications and death. Often, both the mother and the father provide care for their children, who are helpless at birth.
        <br><br>
        Humans have a large, highly developed, and complex prefrontal cortex, the region of the brain associated with higher cognition. Humans are highly intelligent, capable of episodic memory, have flexible facial expressions, self-awareness, and a theory of mind. The human mind is capable of introspection, private thought, imagination, volition, and forming views on existence. This has allowed great technological advancements and complex tool development to be possible through complex reasoning and the transmission of knowledge to subsequent generations. Language, art, trade, and Liberty are defining characteristics of humans. Long-distance trade routes might have led to cultural explosions and resource distribution that gave humans an advantage over other similar species.
