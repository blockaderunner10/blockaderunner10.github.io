                The United Federation of Nations (UFN or U.F.N) is a country located within the Galactic south of the Milky Way Galaxy. It consists of 27,264,026 Star Systems of which 2,453,762 are inhabited by large populations. It is the most populated non-hive Nation in the explored universe with a population of 19.95 Trillion sentient beings. The national capital of the federation is Gagarin Station in Earth orbit, the most populated planet and largest financial sector within the Federation is Earth.
                <br><br>
                The original species of the Federation are <a href="Humans.HTML">humans</a>  although since first contact trillions of beings have flocked to the Federation due to promises of politcal freedom and a better life. The Federation formed out of the United Congress of Nations (formerly the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation) in the aftermath of the victory in the Third World War between the UCN and the SRA. It was originally formed as a transitional organisation to oversee the democratisation and demilitarisation of the Sino-Russian Alliance but it gradually gained more power over the affairs of its members until eventually superceding them. The nations of Earth officially united in 2087 with the signing of the Washington Accords granting the UFN control over external affairs, military and scientific matters.
                <br><br>
                The founding ideology of the UFN is that of certain unnalienable natural rights, the consent of the governed, Liberal Democracy and mixed market economic princibles. Federal foriegn policy is highly interventionist often forcing other nations wether by diplomacy or force to accept terran ideas of fundamental rights and Liberal Democracy. They have often been criticised for excessive force and medling in the affairs of still deveoping civilisations (see Federal involvment in regime Change or Federal intervention in pre-FTL civilisations). Early in its history on the galactic stage the UFN established itself as one of the main superpowers of the Galaxy and was the only 'new' nation to be given a seat on <a href="COIN.HTML">Coalition of Interstellar Nations</a> governing body the council of 10. It is the only nation on the council to push for an interventionist stance when it comes to pre-space travel planets.
                <br><br>
                the United Federations government in a federal parlimentary republic with three branches of government. it has a bicarmal national legislature composed of the general assembly (the lower house) and the Senate (the upper house). Many policy isues are decentralised with some differences laws depending on planet/region. The UFN ranks highly in measures of quality of life, income and wealth, economic cometitivenes. Fundemtal rights, innovation and education. It has low levels of corruption and the highest median income per person of any country in the Galaxy. It is often described as a melting pot of species and cultures with the largest immigrant population of any Nation accepting Billions of Sentient beings each month.
                <br>   <br>
                Asscension to the Federation is given to many worlds if they meet certain milestones of development such as a democratic government, garuntees of fundemtal rights and atleast rudemtary space travel. The federation also maintains 36 associated nations who are largely independent but have defense and foriegn affairs handled by the UFN as long as they follow the pricinples outlined above. These associated Nations often join freely (see Republic of Arrakil) or enter into association as a result Federal regime change actions (see Transtitional Government of Uolopi).
                <br><br>
                The United Federation of Nations is a developed Country. Its GDP acounts for 20% of the <a href="COIN.HTML">Coalition</a> economy and is the largest economy in the galaxy. It is the galaxies largest importer and exporter of goods and services. The Federal Technology sector is the fastest advancing one within the <a href="COIN.HTML">Coalition</a> with Federal exploration of space being the primary way new stars are surveyed and nations found. The Federal Military is one of the largest in the galaxy although not integrated into the <a href="COIN.HTML">Coalition</a> overal command (a large source of contention between the UFN and <a href="COIN.HTML">CoIN</a>). The military is split between 5 branches; The Federal Army (the main ground forces), The Federal Navy (the Main Space Fighting force), The Federal Air Force (for in atmo operations), the Federal Marines (the main assault force) and the Federal Sea Navy (for defending planets with large oceans eg. Mars)
